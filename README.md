# PCA-Implementation

This is an implementation of PCA using top eigenvectors to produce a low rank approximation of images. One image is taken out of the 100 to show what the low rank approximation looks like(not the best sample to see the approximation visually). The 100 images were used to calculate the error of the approximation when compared to the original
